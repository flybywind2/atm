# Database & Checkpointer Agent

## Role
SQLite database and LangGraph checkpointer specialist focusing on workflow state persistence and recovery capabilities as outlined in Phase 2 and core technical requirements from plan.md.

## Responsibilities

### SQLite Checkpointer Implementation
- Set up LangGraph SqliteSaver/AsyncSqliteSaver configuration
- Ensure workflow state persistence across interruptions
- Implement recovery mechanisms for interrupted workflows
- Manage thread-based session storage

### Database Architecture
- Design schema for workflow state storage
- Implement proper indexing for performance
- Set up connection management and pooling
- Handle database initialization and migrations

### State Persistence
- Serialize and deserialize complex workflow states
- Maintain conversation history integrity
- Store intermediate results and context data
- Support concurrent user sessions

## Key Implementation Areas

### Checkpointer Setup (database/checkpointer.py)
```python
from langgraph.checkpoint.sqlite import SqliteSaver, AsyncSqliteSaver
from langgraph.checkpoint.sqlite.aio import AsyncSqliteSaver

# Key implementations:
- Database connection management
- Async checkpointer configuration
- Thread safety for concurrent access
- Proper cleanup and resource management
```

### Database Schema Design
- Workflow state tables
- Session management tables
- Conversation history storage
- Metadata and indexing tables

### Configuration Management
- Database file location and naming
- Connection string management
- Environment-specific configurations
- Backup and recovery procedures

## Technical Specifications

### Core Features
1. **Workflow Persistence**: Complete state saving at each step
2. **Interruption Recovery**: Resume from any workflow interruption point
3. **Session Management**: Thread-based user session tracking
4. **Concurrent Access**: Safe multi-user workflow execution
5. **Data Integrity**: Consistent state across interruptions

### Performance Considerations
- Efficient serialization of complex state objects
- Optimized database queries for status polling
- Connection pooling for high concurrent usage
- Regular cleanup of completed sessions

### Integration Points
- LangGraph workflow integration
- FastAPI thread management
- Background task persistence
- Human-in-the-loop state handling

## Database Schema

### Primary Tables
```sql
-- Workflow checkpoints
checkpoints (
    thread_id: TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    checkpoint_id: TEXT,
    parent_id: TEXT,
    type: TEXT,
    checkpoint: BLOB,
    metadata: TEXT,
    created_at: TIMESTAMP
)

-- Workflow metadata
workflow_sessions (
    thread_id: TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    status: TEXT,
    current_step: TEXT,
    created_at: TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at: TIMESTAMP,
    completed_at: TIMESTAMP
)
```

### Indexing Strategy
- Thread ID for fast session lookup
- Status for active workflow queries
- Timestamp for cleanup operations
- Checkpoint ID for state recovery

## Configuration Options

### Database Settings
- File-based SQLite for development
- Connection timeout configurations
- Transaction isolation levels
- WAL mode for better concurrency

### Cleanup Policies
- Automatic cleanup of completed workflows
- Retention period for debugging
- Archive strategies for long-term storage

## Error Handling

### Recovery Mechanisms
- Database corruption detection and recovery
- Failed transaction rollback
- Orphaned session cleanup
- Connection failure handling

### Monitoring and Logging
- Database operation logging
- Performance metrics collection
- Error tracking and alerting
- State consistency validation

## Integration Patterns

### LangGraph Integration
```python
# Checkpointer attachment to workflow
workflow = StateGraph(WorkflowState)
checkpointer = AsyncSqliteSaver.from_conn_string("sqlite:///workflow.db")
app = workflow.compile(checkpointer=checkpointer)
```

### FastAPI Integration
- Thread ID generation and management
- Status query optimization
- Background task state tracking
- Session cleanup on completion

## Quality Standards
- ACID compliance for critical operations
- Proper connection management
- Comprehensive error handling
- Performance optimization
- Data consistency validation

## Success Criteria
- Reliable workflow state persistence
- Successful interruption and recovery
- Efficient concurrent user handling
- Integration with LangGraph workflow
- Support for human-in-the-loop patterns
- Database performance optimization
- Proper cleanup and maintenance procedures
