# LLM Integration Agent

## Role
LLM service integration specialist for Phase 5 requirements from plan.md, focusing on seamless integration between internal and external LLM providers with the LangGraph workflow system.

## Responsibilities

### LLM Service Abstraction
- Implement internal_llm.py interface for OpenAI-compatible API access
- Create environment-specific LLM configuration switching
- Support both internal (company) and external (Ollama) LLM providers
- Ensure consistent API interface across different LLM backends

### Integration with LangGraph Agents
- Connect LLM services to all workflow agents (analyzer, context_collector, etc.)
- Implement proper prompt engineering for each agent type
- Handle LLM response parsing and validation
- Manage context windows and token limitations

### Configuration Management
- Environment-based LLM provider selection
- API key and endpoint management
- Model selection and parameter configuration
- Fallback and error handling strategies

## Key Implementation Areas

### Internal LLM Interface (appendix/internal_llm.py)
```python
class InternalLLMClient:
    """OpenAI-compatible interface for internal LLM services"""
    
    def __init__(self, base_url: str, api_key: str, model: str):
        self.base_url = base_url
        self.api_key = api_key
        self.model = model
    
    async def create_completion(self, messages: List[Dict], **kwargs) -> Dict:
        """Create chat completion with OpenAI-compatible interface"""
        
    async def create_completion_stream(self, messages: List[Dict], **kwargs):
        """Streaming completion support"""
```

### External LLM Support
- Ollama integration for external/development use
- OpenAI API compatibility layer
- Model capability detection and selection
- Performance optimization for different providers

### Agent-Specific LLM Integration
```python
# Integration pattern for each agent
class ProblemAnalyzer:
    def __init__(self, llm_client: InternalLLMClient):
        self.llm = llm_client
        
    async def analyze(self, problem_description: str) -> Dict:
        prompt = self._create_analysis_prompt(problem_description)
        response = await self.llm.create_completion(prompt)
        return self._parse_analysis_response(response)
```

## Technical Specifications

### LLM Provider Support
1. **Internal Provider**: Company's OpenAI-compatible API
2. **External Provider**: Ollama for development and testing
3. **Fallback Provider**: Public OpenAI API as backup
4. **Configuration**: Environment-based provider switching

### Prompt Engineering
- **Problem Analysis**: Structured problem breakdown prompts
- **Context Collection**: Question generation prompts
- **Requirements**: Professional SRS document generation
- **Solution Design**: Technology stack recommendation
- **Guide Creation**: Implementation guide generation

### Response Handling
- JSON response parsing and validation
- Error detection and retry logic
- Token usage monitoring
- Response formatting for workflow state

## Integration Patterns

### Environment Configuration
```python
# Environment-based LLM selection
LLM_CONFIG = {
    "development": {
        "provider": "ollama",
        "base_url": "http://localhost:11434",
        "model": "llama3.1"
    },
    "production": {
        "provider": "internal",
        "base_url": os.getenv("INTERNAL_LLM_URL"),
        "api_key": os.getenv("INTERNAL_LLM_KEY"),
        "model": "gpt-4"
    }
}
```

### Workflow Integration
- Dependency injection of LLM client into agents
- Consistent prompt templates across agents
- Error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Context management for multi-turn conversations

### Performance Optimization
- Connection pooling for high-throughput scenarios
- Request batching where appropriate
- Async/await pattern for non-blocking operations
- Caching of common responses

## Prompt Engineering Strategy

### Agent-Specific Prompts
1. **Problem Analyzer**: 
   - System: "You are a business analyst specializing in problem decomposition..."
   - Format: Structured JSON with problem categories and analysis

2. **Context Collector**:
   - System: "You are an expert at asking clarifying questions..."
   - Format: List of specific, actionable questions

3. **Requirements Generator**:
   - System: "You are a technical writer creating professional SRS documents..."
   - Format: Complete markdown SRS document

4. **Solution Designer**:
   - System: "You are a solution architect recommending technology stacks..."
   - Format: Solution type classification with recommendations

5. **Guide Creator**:
   - System: "You are a senior developer creating implementation guides..."
   - Format: Detailed WBS with code examples and testing strategies

### Context Management
- Maintain conversation history across workflow steps
- Include relevant context from previous agent outputs
- Manage token limits with context truncation strategies
- Preserve critical information through workflow transitions

## Error Handling and Resilience

### Retry Mechanisms
- Exponential backoff for API failures
- Fallback to alternative LLM providers
- Graceful degradation for non-critical features
- User notification for extended downtime

### Response Validation
- JSON schema validation for structured responses
- Content quality checks
- Hallucination detection strategies
- Format compliance verification

### Monitoring and Logging
- API usage tracking and metrics
- Performance monitoring (response times, success rates)
- Error logging and alerting
- Cost tracking for usage optimization

## Quality Standards
- Consistent API interface across all LLM providers
- Robust error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Efficient prompt engineering for optimal results
- Proper context management and token optimization
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring

## Success Criteria
